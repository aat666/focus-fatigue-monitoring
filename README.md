# focus-fatigue-monitoring
Final Year Project
This project aims to develop a focus and fatigue monitoring system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It helps students track their attention levels and detect fatigue indicators in real-time, providing insights to enhance academic productivity

# Features

Gaze Tracking: Detects whether the user is looking left, right, up, or down.
Blink Detection: Tracks Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect blinks.
Fatigue Detection: Identifies slow blinks, prolonged eye closure, and yawning.
Head Pose Estimation: Detects head tilt and posture.
Real-Time Processing: Ensures smooth and accurate tracking.
Optimized with Genetic Algorithm: Improves hyperparameters dynamically.
